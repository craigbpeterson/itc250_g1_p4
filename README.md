# ITC250 Project 4: RSS News Feed
## Seattle Central College

This is a PHP app for the SurveySez client protosite that gets RSS news feed data from a database and displays a list page of all news feeds, and a view page for each feed.

### Team 1:
* Christy Thom
* Scott Allen
* Craig Peterson

### Notes:
* p4_sql.sql is used to create database tables for RSS Categories and RSS Feeds, and to insert the initial records into those tables
* The folders in this repo should be placed in the "sp18_surveysez" folder of the client protosite.
